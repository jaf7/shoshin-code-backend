A coding practice and mentorship application that integrates coding exercises with an editor and repl, offers real-time session sharing across a network and session saving for any editor state / exercise combination. Features ES6 sandboxed evaluation (no `eval`) & error handling, code highlighting, stateless token-based user authentication/authorization, WebSocket session streaming using unique URLs and exercises from the CodeWars API.

# Shoshin Code
A coding practice and mentorship application that integrates coding exercises with an editor and repl, offers real-time session sharing across a network and session saving for any editor state / exercise combination. Features ES6 sandboxed evaluation (no `eval`) & error handling, code highlighting, secure user authentication (JWT), WebSocket session streaming using unique URLs and exercises from the CodeWars API.

## Motivation
This app is born from a deep appreciation of online coding environments like [Repl.it](https://repl.it). I wanted to use and offer to others a tool that combines the salient features of such environments with real-time session sharing to support mentorship and exercises in the spirit of code Katas. I wanted a clean, elegant experience with crisp interactions that doesn't get in the way and lets the user focus on learning.

## To-do
 - [ ] move `exercise#get_exercises` logic to a [scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler) job for requests to CodeWars API endpoint
 - [ ] Refactor custom styling to [SASS 7-1 pattern](https://gist.github.com/rveitch/84cea9650092119527bc) with [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/) (Block__Element--Modifier)
 - [ ] Add mediaquery breakpoint for tablet portrait mode
 - [ ] Refactor NavigationTabs component to React-MD tabs pattern
 - [ ] Feature: Naming & saving of free-form sessions
 - [ ] Feature: Users can add their own exercises / katas (using a markdown editor component)
 - [ ] Feature: Chat using Pusher Chatkit with WebSockets
 - [ ] Add read/write access toggling for 2nd party
 - [ ] Comprehensively protect against infinite loops
